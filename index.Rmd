- `Summary` - Summary of the mortgage details.
- `Annual Amortization Table` - Displays the estimated interest, principle payment and remaining annual balance.

### Easy Calculations with R

The calculation of monthly payment is done using the R function below:

```{r}
calcMonthlyPayment <- function(principle, monthlyInterest, monthsToPay) {
  return(round(principle * (monthlyInterest/(1-(1+monthlyInterest)^(-monthsToPay))), digits = 2))
}
```

This is demonstrated below with property value $300000, down payment $30000, yearly loan interest rate 5% and total loan payment years equals to 10.

```{r}
# Example calculation of monthly payment
principle <- 300000 - 30000  #principle = propertyValue - downPayment
monthlyInterest <- 5/(12*100)   #monthlyInterest = yearlyInterest/(12*100) 
monthsToPay <- 10 * 12   #monthsToPay = yearsToPay * 12
calcMonthlyPayment(principle, monthlyInterest, monthsToPay)
```

### Calculations with R (continued...)

Procedure to create annual and monthly payment tables:

1. Current month interest payment (`cuMonthInterest`) equals to loan `balance` multiply by `monthlyInterest`.
2. Principle payment for the current month (`cuMonthPrinciple`) equals to monthly payment calculated above minus `cuMonthInterest`.
3. Next new loan `balance` is then equals to old `balance` minus `cuMonthPrinciple`.
4. Procedure is repeated from step one through step three with the new loan `balance` until loan `balance` is zero.
